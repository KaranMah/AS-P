# AS-P Project :fireworks:

__All the required features listed in Elaboration, Construction 1 and Construction 2 are implemented__

Still, with the feedback from the construction 2 demo, there are several minor functionalities that can be further enhanced.

1. For clinic managers, show warning messages when the order exceeds the weight limit

2. For clinic managers, show the items contained in the orders when they navigate to the "__view and track order__" tab

3. For all the users, show their account information in the "__manage account__" tab

The team has made patches in response to the feedback, and these are all included in this release.
